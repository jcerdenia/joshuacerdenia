### Hi, I'm Joshua.

I'm a software developer at [FireVisor](https://firevisor.com/), an AI company creating self-aware factories.

I made a career change from music composition to software development in 2021 and am learning everything I can get my hands on. My daily work includes JavaScript/TypeScript, Angular, React, Node, NestJS, etc. I'm also fond of Kotlin and Android. 

Outside of tech, I enjoy anything to do with culture. I blog regulary at [cerdenia.com](https://cerdenia.com).
