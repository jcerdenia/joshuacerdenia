### Hi, I'm Joshua.

I'm a software developer with [FireVisor](https://firevisor.com/), an AI-powered platform creating self-aware factories. My daily work includes JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Angular, Node, NestJS, etc.

Outside tech, I'm a composer and musician. Find me at [cerdenia.com](https://cerdenia.com).
