### Hi, I'm Joshua.

I'm a full-stack developer working primarily with JavaScript and Python frameworks. I also have a side interest in Android development.

I'm also a composer of chamber and orchestral music. Find me at [cerdenia.com](https://cerdenia.com) (music) and [j.cerdenia.com](https://garden.cerdenia.com) (personal).
