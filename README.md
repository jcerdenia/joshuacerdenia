### Hi, I'm Joshua.

I'm a full stack developer with [FireVisor](https://firevisor.com/), an AI-powered platform creating self-aware factories.

I made the jump to software development in 2021 with a music background and am learning everything I can get my hands on. My daily work includes JavaScript/TypeScript, Angular, React, Node, NestJS, etc. I'm also fond of Kotlin and Android.

In the past, I have been based in Singapore, Baltimore, and New York. Currently I'm working remotely out of the Philippines.

Outside tech, I enjoy all things to do with culture. Find me at [cerdenia.com](https://cerdenia.com).
