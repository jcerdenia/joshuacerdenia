### Hi, I'm Joshua.

I'm a software developer working primarily with JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular, and Node. I'm also interested in Android development with Kotlin. Lately I'm getting more into Python.

Apart from programming, I'm a composer of chamber and orchestral music. Find me at [cerdenia.com](https://cerdenia.com) (music) and [garden.cerdenia.com](https://garden.cerdenia.com) (everything else).
